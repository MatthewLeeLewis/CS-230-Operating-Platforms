# CS-230-Operating-Platforms

Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The Gaming Room wanted me to design a crossplatform simple game where players could connect, join groups, and play called Draw it or Lose it.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  I think my Domain model and UML diagram were particularly strong but it's worth noting all of it was graded quite well.
  
What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  It was helpful for keeping everything organized and structured.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I'm quite pleased with how it all turned out. I don't think I'd revise anything. 
  
How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  It's important because without keeping in mind, the user's needs, the application will surely fail. I interpreted what they needed by determining the best solution to    implement what was required.
  
How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  I approached it systematically by thinking of the big picture and mapping it out followed by 'zooming in' on the more detailed areas and refining. I think this           philosophy works quite well.
